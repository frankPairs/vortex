# Vortex

A project to solve with Rust different distributed system problems from [Fly.io](https://fly.io/dist-sys/1/). The idea to do this project comes from a [video published](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gboGyccRVXI) by [@jonhoo](https://github.com/jonhoo), where I had the opportunity to learn a lot of new interesting topics about Rust.
