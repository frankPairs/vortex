A project aimed at addressing various distributed system problems using Rust, inspired by a [video shared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gboGyccRVXI) by [@jonhoo](https://github.com/jonhoo). In the video, I had the opportunity to delve into numerous intriguing topics about Rust, from which the idea for this project originated.
